# Changelog

## Version 0.x.x (?)

* Correcting small bug that occurred when setSelectionRange() was called on 
  an element that does not support it.


## Version 0.1.1 (2014-07-21)

* Support for IE10 and IE11 touch screens through pointer events.
* Removed `disableTouch` and `disableMouse` options. The goal was to unify
  touch and mouse dragging, so it should not be necessary to disable 
  one or the other.
  
  
## Version 0.1.0 (2014-07-17)

* First version.
